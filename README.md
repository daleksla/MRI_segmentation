# MRI_segmentation
## README

Segmentation tasks on provided brain MRI scans 

### Summary

Non-model based, segmentation algorithms using implemented techniques in MATLAB.

Note: this was developed as a team as part of University coursework. This is designed to pass a series of provided tests, not to be used in production. Code was inspired & adapted in part from lecture contents and other sources. I am hosting this here for fun (aka as a cheap backup and to showcase work)

### Using

Run task\*.m files to see the algorithms in action, or use the functions yourself
